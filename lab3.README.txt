My 3d object is a light green color Cube which contains Pyramids in four faces. 
If you click the left arrow key  the object will rotate in counterclockwise through y axis and right arrow key will rotate clockwise through the same direction. 
Similarly if you hit the up arrow key the object will rotate counterclockwise through x axis and down arrow key will rotate clockwise through the same direction.
event.keycode==37 is used to handle the LEFT arrow key.
event.keycode==38 is used to handle the UP arrow key. 
event.keycode==39 is used to handle the RIGHT arrow key.
event.keycode==40 is used to handle the DOWN arrow key.
